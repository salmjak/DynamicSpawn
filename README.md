# DynamicSpawn
Increases the spawn limits in Pixelmon dynamically based on number of online players (based on the initial max limit set in the pixelmon config for each category and the max number of allowed online players on the server).

Use the .cfg to set the minimum limit (default 0.20 (20% of max limit))
